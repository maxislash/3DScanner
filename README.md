# 3DScanner

Created a 3D Scanner using a LiDAR driven by an Arduino, a LUA program to transfer the data and C++ to reproduce the 3D scene. 

A LiDAR is a laser technology used to measure distance precisely and rapidly. 

With this sensor, I printed in 3D a turret and made it mobile by using servomotors and an Arduino. The turret is placed in a room and when the program is launched it will rotate to map the room. The data were send to the computer using a LUA program and finally the data were used to reconstruct the room in 3D with the library OpenGL.
